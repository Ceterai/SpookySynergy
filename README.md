# Spooky Synergy

A Hallowing Patch Mod for Starbound! **Welcome to [Halloween Ceternity](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3580687852)!**

Get this mod on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3582677809) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Ceterai/SpookySynergy).

## Overview

**Spooky Synergy** is a patch mod for Starbound that connects multiple great Halloween-themed Starbound mods into one cohesive experience.

It does this by:

- Adding new crafting recipes that combine items from these mods.
- Deduplicating items and objects with similar names to add variety and reduce repetition! Though do expect like 50 jack-o-lanterns, nothing I can do about that...
- Making recipe groups and colony tags consistent across recipes and objects from these mods.
- Moving themed decoration recipes from most of these mods in the **Haunted Crafting Table** added by **The Spooky Scary Halloween Special** mod, so you can find all your spooky crafting needs in one place.
- Adding recipes for the vanilla spooky themed furniture set (also in that table).
- Adding recipes for the vanilla tombstones (also in that table).
- Adding missing recipes for some **TSSHS** objects and items.
- Rebalancing prices, rarities and crafting recipes.

## Affected Mods

- [**The Spooky Scary Halloween Special**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787822075) (optional): The foundation of the Hallowing theme, providing majority of the content, a crafting table, a dungeon, etc.
  - Its **pumpkins** and related things were renamed to **turnips** to not clash with **Nazar's Halloween** mod.
  - Fixed **Haunted Bag**'s logic and made it stackable and craftable.
  - Enhanced **Haunted Bag** to include items from other mods and some vanilla items too.
  - I highly recommend also installing the [**The Spooky Scary Halloween Special - Good Game's fixes**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3347411505) mod as it contains a lot of neat fixes.
  - If you don't want to install TSSHS, you can still use this patch mod, and access the recipes from the **Haunted Crafting Table** through **Tabula Rasa** (if you have it).
- [**Nazar's Halloween**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358066460): Adds pumpkins, a lot of colorable pumpkin decorations and A LOT of pumpkin-based dishes.
  - Candy is now used in some recipes in the **Haunted Crafting Table**.
  - Made some food items stackable.
- [**Starbound Halloween Mod**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1546609396): Introduces a variety of different Halloween decorations, including candles!
  - Candles are now used in recipes of all jack-o-lanterns and some other decorations.
  - Candy was renamed and is now used in some recipes in the **Haunted Crafting Table**.
