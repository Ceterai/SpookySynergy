A Hallowing Patch Mod for Starbound! [b]Welcome to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3580687852]Halloween Ceternity[/url]! ðŸŽƒ[/b]
Also available on [url=https://github.com/Ceterai/SpookySynergy]GitHub[/url].
[h2]Overview[/h2]
[b]Spooky Synergy[/b] is a patch mod for Starbound that connects multiple great Halloween-themed Starbound mods into one cohesive experience.
It does this by:
[list][*]Adding new crafting recipes that combine items from these mods.
[*]Deduplicating items and objects with similar names to add variety and reduce repetition! Though do expect like 50 jack-o-lanterns, nothing I can do about that...
[*]Making recipe groups and colony tags consistent across recipes and objects from these mods.
[*]Moving themed decoration recipes from most of these mods in the [b]Haunted Crafting Table[/b] added by [b]The Spooky Scary Halloween Special[/b] mod, so you can find all your spooky crafting needs in one place.
[*]Adding recipes for the vanilla spooky and gothic themed furniture sets (also in that table).
[*]Adding recipes for the vanilla tombstones (also in that table).
[*]Adding missing recipes for some [b]TSSHS[/b] objects and items.
[*]Adding a tiny easter egg.
[*]Rebalancing prices, rarities and crafting recipes.
[*]Adding support for popular mods like [b]Tabula Rasa[/b], [b]Wardrobe Interface[/b], [b]Spawnable Item Pack[/b], [b]Equivalent Exchange[/b], [b]Improved Food Descriptions[/b] and [b]Craftable Seeds[/b].[/list]
[h2]Affected Mods[/h2]
[list][*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787822075]The Spooky Scary Halloween Special[/url][/b] (not necessary, but recommended): The foundation of the Hallowing theme, providing majority of the content, a crafting table, a dungeon, etc.[list]
[*]Its [b]pumpkins[/b] and related things were renamed to [b]turnips[/b] to not clash with [b]Nazar's Halloween[/b] mod.
[*]Fixed [b]Haunted Bag[/b]'s logic and made it stackable and craftable.
[*]Enhanced [b]Haunted Bag[/b] to include items from other mods and some vanilla items too.
[*]I highly recommend also installing the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3347411505]The Spooky Scary Halloween Special - Good Game's fixes[/url] mod as it contains a lot of neat fixes.
[*]If you don't want to install TSSHS, you can still use this patch mod, and access the recipes from the [b]Haunted Crafting Table[/b] through [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=737353165]Tabula Rasa[/url] (if you have it).[/list]
[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358066460]Nazar's Halloween[/url][/b]: Adds pumpkins, a lot of colorable pumpkin decorations and A LOT of pumpkin-based dishes.[list]
[*]Candy is now used in some recipes in the [b]Haunted Crafting Table[/b].
[*]Made some food items stackable.[/list]
[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1546609396]Starbound Halloween Mod[/url][/b]: Introduces a variety of different Halloween decorations, including candles![list]
[*]Candles are now used in recipes of all jack-o-lanterns and some other decorations.
[*]Candy was renamed and is now used in some recipes in the [b]Haunted Crafting Table[/b].[/list]
[*][b][OPTIONAL][/b] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850109963]Elithian Races Mod[/url][/b]: Aside from many additions, it also adds a timed Halloween-themed event called "Harrowing". For full Halloween experience I recommend also installing [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3586407233]Spooky Synergy - The Harrowing[/url][/b], as it adds full integration between the two mods. [b]If not[/b], you still get the following:[list]
[*]The [b]Harrowing Cache[/b] will have its drops enhanced with flasks, cosmetics and candy from the [b]Haunted Bag[/b].
[*]Candy is rebalanced to match the other Halloween mods.[/list][/list]
