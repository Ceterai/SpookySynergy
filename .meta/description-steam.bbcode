A Hallowing Patch Mod for Starbound! [b]Welcome to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3580687852]Halloween Ceternity[/url]! ðŸŽƒ[/b]
Also available on [url=https://github.com/Ceterai/SpookySynergy]GitHub[/url].
[h2]Overview[/h2]
[b]Spooky Synergy[/b] is a patch mod for Starbound that connects multiple great Halloween-themed Starbound mods into one cohesive experience.
It does this by:
[list][*]Adding new crafting recipes that combine items from these mods.
[*]Deduplicating items and objects with similar names to add variety and reduce repetition! Though do expect like 50 jack-o-lanterns, nothing I can do about that...
[*]Making recipe groups and colony tags consistent across recipes and objects from these mods.
[*]Moving themed decoration recipes from most of these mods in the [b]Haunted Crafting Table[/b] added by [b]The Spooky Scary Halloween Special[/b] mod, so you can find all your spooky crafting needs in one place.
[*]Adding recipes for the vanilla spooky themed furniture set (also in that table).
[*]Adding recipes for the vanilla tombstones (also in that table).
[*]Adding missing recipes for some [b]TSSHS[/b] objects and items.
[*]Rebalancing prices, rarities and crafting recipes.[/list]
[h2]Affected Mods[/h2]
[list][*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787822075]The Spooky Scary Halloween Special[/url][/b] (optional): The foundation of the Hallowing theme, providing majority of the content, a crafting table, a dungeon, etc.[list]
[*]Its [b]pumpkins[/b] and related things were renamed to [b]turnips[/b] to not clash with [b]Nazar's Halloween[/b] mod.
[*]Fixed [b]Haunted Bag[/b]'s logic and made it stackable and craftable.
[*]Enhanced [b]Haunted Bag[/b] to include items from other mods and some vanilla items too.
[*]I highly recommend also installing the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3347411505]The Spooky Scary Halloween Special - Good Game's fixes[/url] mod as it contains a lot of neat fixes.
[*]If you don't want to install TSSHS, you can still use this patch mod, and access the recipes from the [b]Haunted Crafting Table[/b] through [b]Tabula Rasa[/b] (if you have it).[/list]
